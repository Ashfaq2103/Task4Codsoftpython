Built an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python at CodSoft, designed to enhance the user experience with clean input handling and score tracking across multiple rounds. This project demonstrates a strong understanding of conditional logic, user interaction, and code efficiency. Key features include:
User Input & Validation: Prompts players to choose "rock," "paper," or "scissors," with validation to ensure valid choices. Additionally, the program includes robust input handling for "Play Again" prompts, re-asking until the user enters either "yes" or "no."
Key Features:
Computer Choice Generation: Uses Python's randomization to simulate a fair opponent choice, making the game unpredictable and engaging.
Game Logic: Implements classic game rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. Accurately identifies ties and winning conditions.
Score Tracking: Maintains scores for both the user and the computer, displayed after each round, encouraging competitive gameplay.
User-Friendly Feedback: Clear feedback after each round, along with the option to restart or exit gracefully.
This project is an excellent demonstration of programming fundamentals and user experience design in console applications.
